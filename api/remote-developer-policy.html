title: Smart Weather API Remote Data Access Policy
---
<div id="main-content">
    <p>This policy, which is subject to change, applies to remote data access (REST, WS). This policy does not apply to local data access (UDP, BLE).</p>
    
    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>All data (observations & metadata) is available to station owners from stations that they own (public or private) via any application. No data (observations or metadata) is available from private stations via any application. Metadata from public stations is available to any user via any application. Observation data from public stations may be available to any user via licensed enterprise applications.</p>
