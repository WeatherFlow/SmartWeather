<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The Smart Weather API supports the Authorization Code grant type.  For clients that are unable to maintain the confidentiality of the client secret, the API also supports the Authorization Code with PKCE grant type.</p>

<h2><a name="overview">Creating a Client Application</a></h2>
<p>Before you can begin using OAuth with the Smart Weather API, you must register your application with WeatherFlow. To do so, please <a href="mailto:support@weatherflow.com?subject=Smart Weather API Key Request">contact us</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="authorization-code-grant">Authorization Code Grant</a></h2>
<p class="step">Step 1:</p>
<p>Request authorization from the user using the authorization endpoint below.</p>
<p><span class="code-highlight">https://smartweather.weatherflow.com/authorize.html</span></p>
<p>With the request include the following query string parameters:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Query String Parameter</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>client_id</td>
        <td>Provided to you when registering your application</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>response_type</td>
        <td>Set this value to <span class="code-highlight">code</span> to indicate that you would like an authorization code returned.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>redirect_uri</td>
        <td>The url you want the user to be redirected to after the authorization is completed.  This url must be registered with WeatherFlow.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p class="step">Step 2:</p>
<p>Once redirected to the authorization page, the user will approve or deny the authorization request.  If they approve the request they will be redirected back to the redirect URL you provided along with an authorization code.</p>
<p>Exchange the authorization code for an access token by making a <span class="code-highlight">POST</span> request to the API endpoint below.</p>
<p><span class="code-highlight">https://swd.weatherflow.com/id/oauth2/token</span></p>

<p>In the URL Encoded Form body of the <span class="code-highlight">POST</span> request include:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Form Field</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>grant_type</td>
        <td>Set this value to <span class="code-highlight">authorization_code</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>code</td>
        <td>Send the authorization code received from the authorization server.  This is the <span class="code-highlight">code</span query string parameter.></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>client_secret</td>
        <td>Send the client secret provided when your application was created. </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p class="hint">If you are not using a server application and cannot properly secure the client secret use the Authorization Code Grant with PKCE method.</p>
