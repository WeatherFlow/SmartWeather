The WeatherFlow Smart Weather Google Action is now live!

Just say "Hey Google, talk to WeatherFlow."  You will be prompted to link your WeatherFlow Smart Weather account.  Once your account is linked you can say things like, "Hey Google, ask WeatherFlow howâ€™s the weather?" and "Hey Google, ask WeatherFlow what is the temperature?"
