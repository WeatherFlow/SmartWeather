Better, faster, stronger. That’s the updated Tempest Smart Weather app in a nutshell, but here are some specifics:
- A New Look: We’ve updated the branding and design of the app, transitioning the logos and app icon from Smart Weather to Tempest.
- A Better Forecast: The main view now includes the current conditions at your station, along with a 10-day hourly forecast. 
But this isn’t your average forecast! Our atmospheric modeling team is using data from your station, combined with data from the ECMWF & NOAA forecast models, 
as well as our own in-house modeling suite. Leveraging powerful machine learning techniques, we’re able to guarantee a scary accurate forecast that only gets better over time.
